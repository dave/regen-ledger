# Contributing to Regen Ledger

:earth_asia: Welcome! We're glad you're here. Planetary regeneration is a big project, and we can definitely use help building the tools to support regenerative land stewardship. :earth_africa:

## Our Software Development Workflow

We follow an agile methodology and use ZenHub and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/issues) for ticket tracking. To understand our current priorities and roadmap, check out [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/milestones).

If you are a first time contributor, check out the issues labeled "[good first issue](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)" and "[help wanted](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)" or send us a message in the #regen-ledger channel of our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/regen-network).

### Using Github Labels

We use [GitHub Labels](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/labels) for issues and pull requests. The following are some general guidelines for using labels.

#### Guidelines for using labels with issues:

- each issue should have one `Type` label
- each issue should have one `Scope` label
- each issue should have one `Status` label
- new issues should always start with `Status: Proposed` or `Status: Bug`
- new issues should be reviewed on a daily basis and updated with the appropriate `Status` label
- ...

#### Guidelines for using labels with pull requests:

- `Type`, `Scope`, and `Status` labels are not required for pull requests because we use semantic commits to define the type and scope of each pull request and each pull request should have a corresponding issue with the appropriate `Type`, `Scope`, and `Status` labels applied
- ...

### Writing Acceptance Tests

With Regen Ledger, we take a [Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) approach to the design and implementation of new features to encourage collaboration among various stakeholders.

After the proto definitions for a new feature are written, and before the new feature is implemented, acceptance tests for the new feature should be written using [Gherkin Syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).

Writing BDD-style tests provide value at three phases of development:

- during the design and specification phase to get alignment on intended behavior, oftentimes with stakeholders who may not be fluent in golang or coding at all
- during the implementation and pull request review phase to ensure tests are being written to test the intended behavior and not just to satisfy code coverage 
- during the documentation phase to provide base-level documentation that acts as a human-readable source of truth for the intended behavior of a feature

With BDD-style tests, the approach is as follows:

What are you building?
How will you test it?
How did you build it?
How did you build the tests?

...

#### Scenarios

- "Scenarios should read like a specification."
- "Scenarios should be thought of as documentation, rather than tests."
- "Scenarios should enable collaboration between business and delivery, not prevent it."
- "Scenarios should support the evolution of the product, rather than obstruct it."
- "Each scenario should only illustrate a single rule."
- "Shorter scenarios are easier to read, understand and maintain."
- ...

#### Rules

- "Rule is a synonym for business requirement and acceptance criterion."
- ...

## The Words of Maya Angelou


> We, unaccustomed to courage<br>
exiles from delight<br>
live coiled in shells of loneliness<br>
until love leaves its high holy temple<br>
and comes into our sight<br>
to liberate us into life.<br>

> Love arrives<br>
and in its train come ecstasies<br>
old memories of pleasure<br>
ancient histories of pain.<br>
Yet if we are bold,<br>
love strikes away the chains of fear<br>
from our souls.<br>

> We are weaned from our timidity<br>
In the flush of love's light<br>
we dare be brave<br>
And suddenly we see<br>
that love costs all we are<br>
and will ever be.<br>
Yet it is only love<br>
which sets us free.<br>

> â€• Maya Angelou<br>
